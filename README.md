# Telsa-Puts: Predict TSLA price movement from Elon's tweets

-----

### Steps for Tendie Success:

1. Download most recent statuses from Elon's twitter
2. Align them with the increase / drop in Tesla stock
3. Train a machine learning model to determine if Elon is having a nervous breakdown
4. ????
5. Lose all your money because you trusted a shitty python script you found on Github

------
### Current Results
- 50.65% Precision... that's better than random, right?
- The model uses XGBoost and makes decisions based on the occurrence of certain words or phrases in a tweet. This really isnt how you should use XGBOsst but whatever.

------
### Improvements to do:

 - Add better keywords for binary classification
 - Use better method for processing tweets than indicating if keywords are present
 - Use different types of machine learning algorithms
 - Use larger datasets of stocks and Elon tweets to train and test on
